// ===========For Authentication============

Great to hear it's working now! The key fixes that resolved the issue were:
Reordering the routes in user_routes.rs to handle /me before /{username}
Adding proper logging throughout the authentication flow
Ensuring the auth middleware was properly configured with the JWT secret
For future reference, the working authentication flow now is:
User logs in -> receives JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies
Protected routes are wrapped with the auth middleware
The middleware checks for the access_token cookie and validates it
If valid, the user ID is extracted and passed to the handler
The handler uses the user ID to fetch and return the user data
Is there anything else you'd like me to explain about how the authentication is working?
