## Debugging Login and Authorization Issues (17/02/2025, 15:39:50)

Login is not working or maybe its the authorization issue, after logging in and tried to access profile page which was meant to be locked (only accessible after logging in), I got redirected to login page. I was supposed to get redirected to profile page after logging in. And also note, we need to store JWTs inside an httpOnly cookie  @+page.svelte @+page.svelte @AuthGuard.svelte @RedirectGuard.svelte @user.ts @middleware.rs @handlers.rs @main.rs  @handlers.rs

Let me help you debug this authentication flow issue. I'll analyze the code and make the necessary changes to fix the login and authorization.

First, let's check the login flow:
1. The backend correctly sets httpOnly cookies for both access and refresh tokens
2. The frontend needs to properly handle these cookies and check authentication

Let me check the auth service implementation:

I see a few issues:

1. The frontend is trying to call `/auth/me` endpoint which doesn't exist in the backend
2. The auth service is not properly handling the refresh token flow
3. The CORS configuration might need adjustment

Let's fix these issues:

1. First, let's add the `/auth/me` endpoint in the backend:
