## Fixing Docker Compose for Rust Compatibility (20/02/2025, 16:57:28)

The error is occurring because the Rust version in the Docker image (1.75) is not compatible with the lock file version (v4) in your project. We need to update the Rust version in the Docker image to a newer one that supports Cargo.lock version 4. Let's modify the docker-compose.yml to use the latest Rust image.

Here's the update:

```yaml:gamie-backend/docker-compose.yml
services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
      - cargo_cache:/usr/local/cargo/registry
      - target_cache:/app/target
      - cargo_git_cache:/usr/local/cargo/git
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
      - redis
    dns:
      - 1.1.1.1
      - 8.8.8.8
    dns_search: []
    dns_opt:
      - timeout:5
      - attempts:3
    environment:
      - RUST_BACKTRACE=1
      - CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/app/target
      - RUST_LOG=warn
      - CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1
      - CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4
      - CARGO_NET_GIT_FETCH_WITH_CLI=true
      - CARGO_HTTP_MULTIPLEXING=false
      - RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=stable  # Add this line to ensure we use the latest stable

  # ... rest of the file remains unchanged ...
```

However, we also need to see your `Dockerfile.dev` to update the Rust version there. Could you please share the contents of your `Dockerfile.dev`? The main issue is in the base image version specified in the Dockerfile, and we need to update it to use a newer Rust version (1.76 or later) that supports Cargo.lock version 4.

The error specifically mentions that the lock file version 4 is not understood by the current version of Cargo, which was introduced in a newer version of Rust. Once you share the Dockerfile.dev, I can provide the complete solution to fix this issue.
