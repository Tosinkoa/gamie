_**User**_

Here is the next step, and I need you to help create step by step on how to approach this tasks. Help return prompts to provide to AI to complete all steps. How to approach database structure, backend structure and the game UI. 
@frontend @backend 


```
===================== Game Room ========================


Game Settings for Rooms

Get game settings by game id
Room settings field type:
	 Input (will have min and max characters and also type, if type number, we set max and min of number. Keeping it simple for now, just type number and text), select

Number chaos room settings:
Order -> Select field type -> Options: Asecending or Desc
Time (seconds)-> Input field, type number, min of 300 and max of  1200
Numbers of players-> Max of 4 and min of 2
Level-> Select field type -> Options: Beginner (1 – 1000) or Skilled (10, 000 – 100, 000) or Master (100, 000 – 1, 000, 000)


=================== Game =====================

Generate a number with 40 counts base on the level. 
Or beginner, we generate any number between 1 – 1000

"Generate a list of 40 unique random numbers between 2 and 999 (inclusive). These numbers should be sorted in ascending order first, and then shuffled such that no number remains in its original position. The final output should show both the correct order (sorted) and the shuffled order (with no number in its original position).
The numbers should be completely random and unique, ensuring no repetitions, and they should be presented in two formats:
    1. The correct order: A list of numbers sorted in ascending order.
    2. The shuffled order: A list of the same numbers but shuffled such that no number remains in its original index compared to the sorted list." 


End result sample:
Correct Order: [23, 42, 141, 142, 147, 152, 177, 180, 266, 270, 323, 361, 362, 441, 446, 447, 479, 524, 541, 561, 565, 568, 593, 600, 603, 631, 674, 705, 727, 735, 736, 755, 813, 820, 830, 837, 840, 879, 951, 962]
Shuffled Order: [603, 962, 180, 568, 447, 147, 565, 270, 361, 593, 524, 541, 561, 727, 141, 951, 362, 142, 840, 755, 177, 820, 323, 813, 736, 879, 735, 266, 830, 441, 152, 631, 479, 674, 837, 42, 600, 705, 446, 23]


===================== How it works==================
For below description, first player means the first user to join the room.
We store the games inside the database/cached (making sure its not revealed to early players) and we only output it to users when the players number is complete. 
And first player can click Start. There should be three seconds countdown when first player clicked Start. 
If first player leave the game 2nd player inherit first player role/capabilty, 2nd player leaves, 3rd player inherit. 
When players left and it remains a single player, we end the game and display winner. 
Winner is displayed based on users scores, i.e first, second, third, and fourth (Depending on amount of players).
If game is yet to be started and player is not completed for a particular room, and one player left, we remove the ex player data/history from the room (unless they join back). So another user can join.
When all players leave a room, room get deleted automatically.
User can only create a room at once (more than one room should not be allowed)

We would be returning some important data in realtime needed for UI -> Some I can remember for now are: Data of players that joined (username and profile picture).

============= Backend Playing of game ===================
User tries to rearrange the shuffled numbers. 
We give all players in the room same generated shuffled numbers.
We store the correct numbers inside the database/cached (making sure its not revealed to players to avoid cheating) 
Whenever player moves a number and place in right order, we return something like this [true, false, false, false, true, ...] (indicating first and fifth number were placed in the correct position, same will apply to any correct position). 
All should return true when all position are correct (Each position are always checked whenever player move a number).
Moving a number to valid position makes user earn 4 point, moving number 1secs right after moving one number gives user 5 extra points, 2 secs give 4 extra points and 3 secs gives 3 extra points, 4secs gives  2 extra points and 5 secs gives 5 extra points.
After completing a game, Player has to options on the game UI, Play again and Leave button. First player to click player again 
We would be returning some important data in realtime needed for UI -> Some I can remember for now are: Scores, total number arranged, number left to be arranged


============= Frontend Playing of game ==================
On the rooms page, we need to make it real time, when a room is deleted, we show it real time, when a room is added, we show it real time, when a player join a room we show the player count real time and when player leave a room player count realtime.

In the game page we show player count real time too. When player move a piece, we show it real time. 
```

_**Assistant**_

Below is a step‐by‐step plan along with sample prompts you could use to instruct an AI to generate output for each major part of the project. You can use these as “mini‐prompts” to break the work into manageable pieces. I’ve broken the work into three main areas (database, backend, and game UI) and included sample prompt ideas for each area.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 1: Analyze and Summarize Requirements  
─────────────────────────────  
• Review the detailed game room settings, game logic, and UI requirements.  
• List out the following key aspects:  
  – Game room settings (fields and types: input/select; constraints like min/max, options, etc.)  
  – The logic for generating the sorted and shuffled numbers (including “no number remains in its original position”)  
  – Game flow details (first player role inheritance, countdown, scoring rules, ending conditions)  
  – Real-time updates (rooms added/deleted, player joining/leaving, score updates, etc.)  

Sample prompt for this step (for documentation purposes):  
"Summarize the requirements for a game room where users can join a room, configure settings (like order, time, player count, and level), and then play a game that generates 40 unique numbers in sorted and shuffled order (ensuring no number is in its original index). Include rules for host inheritance, scoring details based on move timing, and real-time UI updates. Produce a numbered list of project requirements."

─────────────────────────────  
Step 2: Database Structure  
─────────────────────────────  
Plan your database schema by identifying key entities and their fields. For example, consider these entities:  

1. Room/Game Session  
  • room_id (primary key)  
  • game_id  
  • current_state (waiting, started, finished)  
  • created_at, updated_at timestamps  

2. Game Settings  
  • room_id (foreign key to Room)  
  • settings such as order (select options), time (min/max), players (min/max), level (with option ranges)  

3. Players  
  • player_id  
  • username, profile_picture  
  • room_id (foreign key)  
  • score, join_time, etc.  

You might also add a table for storing the actual game instance details (sorted list, shuffled list) temporarily until the game starts.  

Sample prompt:  
"Based on the following requirements for the game room and game session—where rooms hold game settings (order, time, player count, level), players join a room, and a game is generated with a sorted and shuffled list of 40 unique numbers—generate an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and SQL DDL statements. Please include tables for Room, GameSettings, Players, and GameInstance with appropriate fields and constraints."

─────────────────────────────  
Step 3: Backend Structure and Logic  
─────────────────────────────  
Since the backend is in Rust (as seen from the Cargo.toml and Dockerfile), design your Rust backend to handle the following:  

• API endpoints for:  
  – Creating a room (ensuring a user can have only one active room)  
  – Joining/leaving a room  
  – Fetching game settings by game id  
  – Starting a game (with the 3-second countdown)  
  – Submitting moves and checking piece placement positions (returning an array of booleans for each index)  

• Game logic:  
  – Generate the list of 40 unique random numbers based on the selected level.  
  – Produce a sorted list and then derive a “shuffled” list by shuffling such that no number remains in its original index.  
  – Score computations based on immediate move timing (bonus points if the next move is within specified seconds).  
  – Reassign host role if the first player leaves, end the game if only one player remains, and delete the game room when all players leave.  

• Real-time support:  
  – Consider using WebSockets so that updates (player join/leave, player moves, score updates) are pushed to the frontend immediately.

Sample prompt:  
"Design a Rust backend service for a game where users can join a room and play a number arrangement game. Include API endpoints for room creation, player join/leave, game start, and move submission. Generate Rust pseudocode or a project structure outline that covers game session management (including host inheritance, countdown start, and scoring logic), list generation (sorted list and shuffled list with no number in the same index), and real-time updates (using WebSocket if needed). Also list any crates you might use (like Actix-web or Tokio) for these tasks."

─────────────────────────────  
Step 4: Game UI (Frontend) Structure  
─────────────────────────────  
For the frontend (using Svelte/Vite as indicated), plan the following components:  

• A lobby/rooms page that:  
  – Displays available rooms in real time (adding and removing rooms as they are created or deleted)  
  – Shows player counts update as players join or leave  
  – Allows the user to create or join a room  

• A game page that:  
  – Displays two views:  
   1. The correct number order (sorted)  
   2. The shuffled order where the player will rearrange numbers  
  – Provides interactive UI to let a user move numbers to a valid position  
  – Shows real-time updates: number of correctly placed pieces, score updates, and player count.  
  – Includes actions for “Play Again” and “Leave” once the game round is completed.  

• Integration of WebSocket (or similar real-time technology) to update UI elements immediately on game state changes.

Sample prompt:  
"Generate a Svelte component design for the game’s UI. The design should include a lobby page that updates in real time when rooms are created, deleted, or updated, and a game page that displays a sorted list of numbers alongside a shuffled list that the user can interact with. The game page should update in real time (e.g., player count, correct piece positions, and scores) as players make moves. Provide a component breakdown and pseudocode or Svelte code snippets that handle these functionalities."

─────────────────────────────  
Step 5: Integration and Real-Time Communication  
─────────────────────────────  
Combine backend and frontend concerns by ensuring:  

• The backend publishes updates (e.g., via WebSocket) about any room changes and game state updates.  
• The frontend subscribes to these updates and re-renders the affected UI components immediately.  
• Define a protocol or JSON structure for the messages sent over real-time channels so that both sides know how to interpret the data (such as players list updates, board state, move correctness, and score updates).

Sample prompt:  
"Outline a protocol specification for real-time messaging between a Rust backend and a Svelte frontend for a game room application. The protocol should include event types such as room creation, room deletion, player join, player leave, game start countdown, move update (with correctness and score changes), and game end. Provide sample JSON messages and a short description of how the frontend should handle each event."

─────────────────────────────  
Step 6: Putting It All Together  
─────────────────────────────  
Once you have the prompts for database design, backend structure, and UI components, the next steps are:  

• Ask the AI for an ERD and DDL based on the provided database requirements.  
• Request the AI to generate Rust code outlines (or pseudocode) for API routes and game logic.  
• Have the AI provide Svelte component outlines/pseudocode for the room list and game board, including real-time update handling.  
• Lastly, compile the real-time message protocol for end-to-end integration.

─────────────────────────────  
Conclusion  
─────────────────────────────  
By breaking down the tasks and creating a clear set of prompts for each area, you can iteratively build the complete system. Use the sample prompts above to instruct the AI to deliver concrete designs and code that you can then integrate, test, and adapt.

These prompts cover the overall approach to the database structure, backend service (in Rust), and frontend UI (in Svelte), ensuring that all requirements are addressed step by step.

_**User**_

Base on all the informations you have here, help create the game and rooms functions/logics on the backend first. You can start with either of the two.

---

_**Assistant**_

Below is one way to start working on your backend’s game/room logic in Rust. I’ll explain a step‐by‐step approach and then provide a sample Rust module (e.g., game_logic.rs) that outlines the key types and functions. You can later integrate (or expand on) these functions in your API endpoints.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 1: Define Core Data Structures  
─────────────────────────────  
• Create a GameRoom struct that holds:  
  – A room id  
  – The current list of players (with a “host” value/flag)  
  – The game settings (like order, time, players count, level)  
  – A state indicator (Waiting, Started, Finished)  
  – An optional GameInstance holding the game data once started  
• Create a GameInstance struct that holds the generated lists:  
  – The sorted list (correct order)  
  – The shuffled list (the deranged order that players will manipulate)

─────────────────────────────  
Step 2: Room Management Functions  
─────────────────────────────  
• write a join function: Check that the room isn’t full (using settings like max players) and add the new player.  
• write a leave function: Remove the player, and if the player was the host, reassign the host (for example, to the first player remaining).  
• Optionally, handle deletion of the room when empty.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 3: Start Game / Generate Game Data  
─────────────────────────────  
• When starting the game (after conditions such as room full), run a 3‑second countdown (this can be managed at the API/WebSocket level).  
• Then, generate 40 unique random numbers based on the level’s range. For simplicity, you might start with the beginner range (1–1000) and later expand to use Skilled/Master ranges.  
• Sort the numbers so you have the “correct order.”  
• Use an algorithm (for example, Sattolo’s algorithm) to produce a derangement – that is, a shuffled list where no number remains at its original index.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 4: Sample Code (game_logic.rs)
─────────────────────────────  

Below is a sample module that you could create at backend/src/game_logic.rs:

---------------------------------------------------
/* backend/src/game_logic.rs */

use rand::seq::SliceRandom;

    // For simplicity we are modeling level as a range (min, max)
    Level { range: (u32, u32) },
    // You can add other settings like order, time and player count as needed.
    Order { options: Vec<String> },
    Time { min: u32, max: u32 },
    PlayerCount { min: u32, max: u32 },
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct GameRoom {
    pub room_id: String,
    pub host: String, // the host's identifier (e.g., username or id)
    pub players: Vec<String>,
    pub settings: HashMap<String, RoomSetting>,
    pub state: GameState,
    pub game_instance: Option<GameInstance>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct GameInstance {
    pub sorted_numbers: Vec<u32>,
    pub shuffled_numbers: Vec<u32>,
    // Optionally, add additional data like current moves, scores, etc.
}

impl GameRoom {
    // Create a new game room with the creator as host
    pub fn new(room_id: String, host: String, settings: HashMap<String, RoomSetting>) -> Self {
         Self {
             room_id,
             host: host.clone(),
             players: vec![host],
             settings,
             state: GameState::Waiting,
             game_instance: None,
         }
    }

    // Join a room – checking with max players from settings (if set)
    pub fn join(&mut self) -> Result<(), String> {
         // For proper check, assume we have a "player_count" setting.
         if let Some(RoomSetting::PlayerCount { min: _, max }) = self.settings.get("player_count") {
             if self.players.len() as u32 >= *max {
                 return Err("Room is full".to_string());
             }
         }
         // Here, the caller should have already verified the player isn’t already in the room.
         // For clarity, we assume the new player's id is passed in a real endpoint.
         Ok(())
    }

    // This is a helper: add a player once join() check has passed.
    pub fn add_player(&mut self, player: String) {
         self.players.push(player);
    }

    // Leave a room, and if the leaving player is the host, reassign host if possible.
    pub fn leave(&mut self, player: &str) {
         self.players.retain(|p| p != player);
         if self.host == player {
              if let Some(new_host) = self.players.first() {
                   self.host = new_host.clone();
              }
         }
         // Optionally, if players is empty you might mark the room for deletion.
    }

    // Start the game – make sure conditions are met; then generate the game instance.
    pub fn start_game(&mut self) -> Result<(), String> {
          if self.state != GameState::Waiting {
              return Err("Game already started or finished".to_string());
          }
          // Validate room conditions are met (e.g., right number of players)
          if let Some(RoomSetting::PlayerCount { min, max: _ }) = self.settings.get("player_count") {
              if self.players.len() < *min as usize {
                  return Err("Not enough players to start the game".to_string());
              }
          }
          // For simplicity, use the level setting to decide on the number range.
          // Here we assume "level" exists. In a more complete code, you would pass the explicit chosen value.
          let (min_range, max_range) = if let Some(RoomSetting::Level { range }) = self.settings.get("level") {
              *range
          } else {
              (1, 1000) // default to beginner settings
          };

          match generate_game_numbers(min_range, max_range, 40) {
              Ok((sorted, deranged)) => {
                   self.game_instance = Some(GameInstance { sorted_numbers: sorted, shuffled_numbers: deranged });
                   self.state = GameState::Started;
                   Ok(())
              }
              Err(e) => Err(e),
          }
    }
}

// Function to generate 40 unique random numbers in a given range,

}

─────────────────────────────  
Step 5: Next Steps  
─────────────────────────────  
• You can now integrate these functions into your Actix-web (or chosen framework) endpoints.  
• Create endpoints for creating a room (calls GameRoom::new), joining/leaving (calls join/add_player and leave), and for starting the game (calls start_game, returns the generated game instance data).
• Later you can expand to add move verification logic, scoring functions, and real-time updates (using WebSockets).

This module gives you a solid starting point for handling game rooms and generating the game “board” data on the backend. You can further refine error handling, concurrency, and data persistence as needed.

Let me know if you’d like to proceed with integrating these functions into your web API endpoints or need help on any specific parts.

I'll help create the backend game and room logic, starting with examining the current backend structure and then implementing the necessary components. Let me first check what we have in the backend.

Great! Now I'll create the necessary game and room logic. We'll need to:
1. Create models for games and rooms
2. Implement the game logic
3. Set up WebSocket handlers for real-time updates

Let's start by creating the models and game logic. I'll create a new game module:
