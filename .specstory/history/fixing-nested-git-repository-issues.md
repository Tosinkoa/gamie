Okay, the user is having a problem with Git. Let me look at the error messages they provided.

First, they ran `git remote -v` in the gamie-frontend directory, which shows that it's a valid Git repository connected to their GitHub repo. Then, when they tried to `git add .` in the parent directory ~/Personal/gamie, they got an error: "'gamie-frontend/' does not have a commit checked out". Hmm, that sounds like the gamie directory might be a Git repository itself, and the gamie-frontend subdirectory is another Git repo. So Git is confused because there's a nested repository.

Nested Git repositories can cause issues because Git doesn't track submodules by default unless they're explicitly added. The error suggests that the gamie-frontend subdirectory is a separate repo, and the parent gamie repo is trying to add it as a regular directory, but since it's a repo without a checked-out commit (maybe it's bare or in a weird state), it's failing.

So the solution would be to either convert the gamie-frontend submodule into a proper Git submodule or remove its .git directory so it's treated as a normal subdirectory. Since the user might not have intended to use submodules, removing the .git folder in gamie-frontend would make the parent repo recognize those files normally. But they should check if they have any important data in the gamie-frontend repo before deleting anything.

I should explain both options: removing the nested .git directory or adding it as a submodule. But the most straightforward fix for their case is probably removing the nested repository so the parent can track the files.

The error occurs because you have a nested Git repository - the parent directory `gamie` is trying to add a subdirectory `gamie-frontend` that itself is a Git repository. Here's how to fix this:

```bash
# Remove the nested Git repository configuration
rm -rf ~/Personal/gamie/gamie-frontend/.git

# Then try adding again
cd ~/Personal/gamie
git add .
```

This removes the nested repository's Git configuration while keeping your code files intact. After this, you should be able to add all files from the parent `gamie` repository normally.

If you need to keep `gamie-frontend` as a separate repository, you should instead set it up as a Git submodule:
```bash
cd ~/Personal/gamie
git submodule add git@github.com:Tosinkoa/gamie-frontend.git
```
