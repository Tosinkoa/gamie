## Fixing Docker Rust Version Compatibility (20/02/2025, 16:59:35)

I see the issue. The error occurs because there's a version mismatch between your Cargo.lock file and the Rust version being used in the Dockerfile.dev. The error message states:

```
lock file version `4` was found, but this version of Cargo does not understand this lock file, perhaps Cargo needs to be updated?
```

This means your Cargo.lock was created with a newer version of Rust (likely 1.81 as shown in your production Dockerfile), but you're trying to use Rust 1.75 in your development environment.

Let me fix this by updating the Rust version in your Dockerfile.dev to match your production Dockerfile.

I'll edit the Dockerfile.dev file:

---

_****_

```diff
- FROM rust:1.75-slim as builder
+ FROM rust:1.81-slim as builder
  
  # Install dependencies for building
      rm -rf cargo-watch.tar.xz cargo-watch-v8.4.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
  
- FROM rust:1.75-slim
+ FROM rust:1.81-slim
  
  # Copy cargo-watch from builder
```

---

Now that I've updated the Rust version to match your production environment, you should be able to run `docker compose up --build` successfully. The error should be resolved since we're now using a version of Rust that understands your Cargo.lock file format.

Try running:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This change ensures that your development environment matches your production environment in terms of Rust version, which is a good practice to maintain consistency across environments.

Let me know if you encounter any other issues!

I see the issue. The error shows that Docker is unable to resolve the host `objects.githubusercontent.com` when trying to download cargo-watch. This is likely a DNS resolution issue. Looking at your `docker-compose.yml`, you already have DNS settings, but let's modify the Dockerfile.dev to use the same DNS settings during build time.

I'll modify the Dockerfile.dev to ensure proper DNS resolution:

---

_****_

```diff
  FROM rust:1.81-slim as builder
  
+ # Set DNS servers
+ RUN echo "nameserver 1.1.1.1" > /etc/resolv.conf && \
+     echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" >> /etc/resolv.conf
+ 
  # Install dependencies for building
  RUN apt-get update && \
```

Now try building again with:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

If you still encounter issues, we can try an alternative approach by:
1. Either installing cargo-watch through cargo instead of downloading the binary
2. Or using a different mirror for downloading the binary

Let me know if you still face any issues, and I'll help you with the alternative approaches.

Is this server ready, cuz I'm currently unable to connect with it

_**Assistant**_

I notice that while the services are running, I don't see any log indicating that your backend server is actually listening on any port. Let me search for the server configuration to help diagnose this.

I see the issue. The server is running but it needs some environment variables to be properly configured. Looking at the code, particularly in `config.rs`, the server requires several environment variables to be set:

1. `HOST`
2. `PORT`
3. `DATABASE_URL`
4. `FRONTEND_URL`
5. `JWT_SECRET`

Let me help you set these up in your docker-compose.yml:

---

_****_

```diff
        - CARGO_NET_GIT_FETCH_WITH_CLI=true
        - CARGO_HTTP_MULTIPLEXING=false
+       - HOST=0.0.0.0
+       - PORT=8000
+       - DATABASE_URL=mongodb://mongodb:27017/gamie
+       - FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
+       - JWT_SECRET=your_development_secret_key
+       - RUST_ENV=development
  
    mongodb:
```

---

_****_



Now try running the server again with:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The server should now be properly configured and listening on port 8000. You should be able to:

1. Access the API at `http://localhost:8000`
2. See the API documentation at the root endpoint which will show available routes
3. Connect to it from your frontend running on port 5173

The server will accept connections from:
- Frontend URL: `http://localhost:5173` (in development mode)
- API URL: `http://localhost:8000`

The MongoDB database will be available at `mongodb://localhost:27017` from your host machine, or at `mongodb://mongodb:27017` from within the Docker network.

Let me know if you still have any connection issues!
